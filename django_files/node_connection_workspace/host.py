"""
This class defines an object that represents a single parking lot host.
A host node will instantiate one instance of this per geographical lot it
manages (usually 1).

1. Send request to server for next available Lot ID
2. Create new Host object (give it unused name0 with this ID.
3. Pickle Host Object and Transmit to Server.
